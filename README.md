# Spin-Precession
An Undergrade volueentering Project with Professor Rajibul at IQC, the university of Waterloo, On graphical representation of quantum mechanical probibilitys of state in n direction in addition to visialiazation of quantum states in a block sphere, with the hamiltonian in the general direction under the influence of magnetic field.
